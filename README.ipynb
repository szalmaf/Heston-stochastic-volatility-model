    "In the notebooks I'll discuss various implementations of the Heston stochastic volatility model of pricing European options. This stochastic volatility model is described by two stochastic differential equations: one for the stock process, and another one for the volatility process both driven by their respective Brownian motions:\n",

    "dS_t & = \\sqrt{v_t} S_t dB_t, \\qquad S_0 > 0 \\\\\n",
    "dv_t & = \\kappa (\\theta-r_t) dt + \\sigma\\sqrt{v_t}(\\rho dB_t + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} dW_t), \\qquad v_0 > 0.\n",

    "The $S_t$ stock price process is driven $B_t$ Brownian motion, and the volatility, $v_t$, is driven by $W_t$ Brownian motion mixed with $B_t$ so that the volatility is driven by a Brownian motion that has $\\rho$ correlation with $B_t$. $W_t$ is independent of $B_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stock price process is similar to a geometric Brownian motion except that its volatility is a stochastic process instead of being constant or deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volatility process is a CIR process, a mean reversion process which has mean-reversion level $\\theta$ and the volatility mean revert to this level at the mean-reversion speed $\\kappa$. $\\sigma$ is volatility of the volatility process (vol of vol).\n",

    "$B$ and $W$ are two independent $\\Q$-Brownian motions generating the filtration $F_t$\n",
