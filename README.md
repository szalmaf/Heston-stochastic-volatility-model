# Heston-stochastic-volatility-model

In the notebooks I'll discuss various implementations of the Heston stochastic volatility model of pricing European options.

For further explanation of the model used, please, visit README.ipynb


$$
E = \frac{mc^2}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
$$

with some more inline Latex $\gamma$, $\lambda$, $\theta$

```math
SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
```
